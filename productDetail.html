           Satsuma oranges, known as Citrus unshiu and many other names are a species that is of chinese origins but introduced in many other parts of the world.

           Originating from china it is known as an unshu mikan. One of the most defining features of this type of orange is that it is one of the sweetest citrus varieties and yet with a meltingly tender texture. Another unique feature is that physically they are particularly delicate to the touch and such cannot stand careless handling. It has a uniquely loose skin which often hides bruising and damage in it's outward appearence.
