            <p>
              The joys of the fall season often come in many kinds of suprises. One of the produce by our local farms gives such delight by showing up with large amoutns of carrots. These carrots in particular, however, are actually varied in their colours that they come in. There is no differnce to their nutrition or taste but the colour offers a fun way to enjoy vegetables naturally. Farmer kylan expresses why they decided to create these fun treats.

              "I just wanted to share my love of vegetables with the season as well as make it fun for everyone to enjoy."

              Farmer Kylan expressed that no matter what, there should always be time to have fun and if he can expressed that in his work then all the more motavation. He sees everyday as if it was an enjoyment. The carrot's colors were the result of his hard work thinking about what could be a good addition to the autumn scene as well as a great way to introduce vegetables to everyone. We will be catalouging these carrots within the week and will be available to purchase throughout the fall season until November 16th.
